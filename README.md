# PROJECT: TESTING PRACTICE Using Jest

## ðŸ¤” WIL/Thoughts
1. TDD's main idea is simply start working working on code by writing automated tests **BEFORE** writing the code that is being tested. 
2. There are many test-running systems in Javascript: Jasmine, Jest, Tape, Mocha. They have their special features but the syntax is very similar. 
3. Writing tests is less about the syntax but more on the TDD philosophy, so I tried internalizing the concepts using Jest. Main goal is to know the why and what to test.
