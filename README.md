# PROJECT: Implement Calulator method using TDD

## Basic Concept
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written to pass the test and make the code simple and bug-free.Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.

TDD's main idea is simply start working working on code by writing automated tests BEFORE writing the code that is being tested.

## TDD cycle
1. Write a test
2. Make it run.
3. Change the code to make it right i.e. Refactor.
4. Repeat process.
